activityLabels - comes from activity_labels.txt

Activity files -

Subject files

featureTrain

The activity files/subject files and feature files were merged with rbind() function

Subject data and activity data are merged with cbind() function
This merged data is then combined with features data to get the final data
Mean and standard deviation are the only two information extracted in the final data

Dataset has descriptive names
Acc - Accelerometer
Gyro - Gyroscope
Mag - Magnitude
BodyBody - Body
f - frequency
t - time

Independent clean data set is finally produced with mean calculated for each activity/subject
